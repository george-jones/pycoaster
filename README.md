Roller Coaster Designer, written in Python

Written way before Planet Coaster (good game), this project was my effort at designing roller coasters in a flexible way. Back then, roller coaster designer games were extremely inflexible, basically only allowing predesigned track segments to be placed. This project allowed you to pick the starting point and any ending point for a track segment. It uses cubic spline interpolation using numpy to make a smooth path.
